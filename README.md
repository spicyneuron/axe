# axe

A CLI tool for managing and running LLM-powered agents.

## Why Axe?

Most AI tooling assumes you want a chatbot. A long-running session with a massive context window doing everything at once. But that's not how good software works. Good software is small, focused, and composable.

Axe treats LLM agents the same way Unix treats programs. Each agent does one thing well. You define it in a TOML file, give it a focused skill, and run it from the command line. Pipe data in, get results out. Chain agents together. Trigger them from cron, git hooks, or CI. Whatever you already use. No daemon, no GUI, no framework to buy into. Just a binary and your configs.

## Overview

Axe orchestrates LLM-powered agents defined via TOML configuration files. Each
agent has its own system prompt, model selection, skill files, context files,
working directory, persistent memory, and the ability to delegate to sub-agents.

Axe is the executor, not the scheduler. It is designed to be composed with
standard Unix tools — cron, git hooks, pipes, file watchers — rather than
reinventing scheduling or workflow orchestration.

## Features

- **Multi-provider support** — Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama (local models)
- **TOML-based agent configuration** — declarative, version-controllable agent definitions
- **Sub-agent delegation** — agents can call other agents via LLM tool use, with depth limiting and parallel execution
- **Persistent memory** — timestamped markdown logs that carry context across runs
- **Memory garbage collection** — LLM-assisted pattern analysis and trimming
- **Skill system** — reusable instruction sets that can be shared across agents
- **Stdin piping** — pipe any output directly into an agent (`git diff | axe run reviewer`)
- **Dry-run mode** — inspect resolved context without calling the LLM
- **JSON output** — structured output with metadata for scripting
- **Built-in tools** — file operations (read, write, edit, list), shell command execution, all sandboxed to the agent's working directory
- **Minimal dependencies** — two direct dependencies (cobra, toml); all LLM calls use the standard library

## Installation

Requires Go 1.24+.

```bash
go install github.com/jrswab/axe@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrswab/axe.git
cd axe
go build .
```

## Quick Start

Initialize the configuration directory:

```bash
axe config init
```

This creates the directory structure at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/axe/` with a sample
skill and a default `config.toml` for provider credentials.

Scaffold a new agent:

```bash
axe agents init my-agent
```

Edit its configuration:

```bash
axe agents edit my-agent
```

Run the agent:

```bash
axe run my-agent
```

Pipe input from other tools:

```bash
git diff --cached | axe run pr-reviewer
cat error.log | axe run log-analyzer
```

## CLI Reference

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `axe run <agent>` | Run an agent |
| `axe agents list` | List all configured agents |
| `axe agents show <agent>` | Display an agent's full configuration |
| `axe agents init <agent>` | Scaffold a new agent TOML file |
| `axe agents edit <agent>` | Open an agent TOML in `$EDITOR` |
| `axe config path` | Print the configuration directory path |
| `axe config init` | Initialize the config directory with defaults |
| `axe gc <agent>` | Run memory garbage collection for an agent |
| `axe gc --all` | Run GC on all memory-enabled agents |
| `axe version` | Print the current version |

### Run Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--model <provider/model>` | from TOML | Override the model (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `--skill <path>` | from TOML | Override the skill file path |
| `--workdir <path>` | from TOML or cwd | Override the working directory |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | 120 | Request timeout |
| `--dry-run` | false | Show resolved context without calling the LLM |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | false | Print debug info (model, timing, tokens) to stderr |
| `--json` | false | Wrap output in a JSON envelope with metadata |

## Agent Configuration

Agents are defined as TOML files in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/axe/agents/`.

```toml
name = "pr-reviewer"
description = "Reviews pull requests for issues and improvements"
model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
system_prompt = "You are a senior code reviewer. Be concise and actionable."
skill = "skills/code-review/SKILL.md"
files = ["src/**/*.go", "CONTRIBUTING.md"]
workdir = "/home/user/projects/myapp"
tools = ["read_file", "list_directory", "run_command"]
sub_agents = ["test-runner", "lint-checker"]

[sub_agents_config]
max_depth = 3       # maximum nesting depth (hard max: 5)
parallel = true     # run sub-agents concurrently
timeout = 120       # per sub-agent timeout in seconds

[memory]
enabled = true
last_n = 10         # load last N entries into context
max_entries = 100   # warn when exceeded

[params]
temperature = 0.3
max_tokens = 4096
```

All fields except `name` and `model` are optional.

## Tools

Agents can use built-in tools to interact with the filesystem and run commands.
When tools are enabled, the agent enters a conversation loop — the LLM can make
tool calls, receive results, and continue reasoning for up to 50 turns.

### Built-in Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_directory` | List contents of a directory relative to the working directory |
| `read_file` | Read file contents with line-numbered output and optional pagination (offset/limit) |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file, creating parent directories as needed |
| `edit_file` | Find and replace exact text in a file, with optional replace-all mode |
| `run_command` | Execute a shell command via `sh -c` and return combined output |
| `call_agent` | Delegate a task to a sub-agent (controlled via `sub_agents`, not `tools`) |

Enable tools by adding them to the agent's `tools` field:

```toml
tools = ["read_file", "list_directory", "run_command"]
```

The `call_agent` tool is not listed in `tools` — it is automatically available
when `sub_agents` is configured and the depth limit has not been reached.

### Path Security

All file tools (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`) are
sandboxed to the agent's working directory. Absolute paths, `..` traversal, and
symlink escapes are rejected.

### Parallel Execution

When an LLM returns multiple tool calls in a single turn, they run concurrently
by default. This applies to both built-in tools and sub-agent calls. Disable
with `parallel = false` in `[sub_agents_config]`.

## Providers

| Provider | API Key Env Var | Default Base URL |

Base URLs can be overridden with `AXE_<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL` environment variables
or in `config.toml`.
