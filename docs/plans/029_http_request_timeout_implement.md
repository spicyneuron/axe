# Implement 029: Add 15-Second Per-Request HTTP Timeout to `url_fetch` Tool

**Spec:** `docs/plans/029_http_request_timeout_spec.md`  
**Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Branch:** `issue-17-url-fetch-timeout-html-strip` (off `develop`)

## Section 1: Context Summary

The `url_fetch` tool currently relies solely on the parent agent-runner context (default 120s) for timeout protection. A slow or unresponsive server can block an entire agent run for up to two minutes. This implementation adds a 15-second per-request timeout using `context.WithTimeout`, matching the TypeScript implementation's behavior. The approach is idiomatic Go — nested contexts where the shorter deadline wins automatically. No new dependencies, no public API changes, no configuration surface. All work is scoped to `internal/tool/url_fetch.go` and its test file.

## Section 2: Implementation Checklist

Red/green TDD — tests first (red), then implementation (green). All tasks are sequential; there are no independent sub-tasks that benefit from parallel execution within this milestone.

### Phase 1: Tests (Red)

- [x] **Add test `TestURLFetch_PerRequestTimeout`** — `internal/tool/url_fetch_test.go`: new test function `TestURLFetch_PerRequestTimeout`. Stand up an `httptest.NewServer` whose handler sleeps longer than the per-request timeout (e.g., blocks for 2 seconds). Pass a `context.Background()` (no parent deadline) so only the per-request timeout can fire. Use a short timeout override (see Phase 2 task on the constant) to keep the test fast. Assert: `result.IsError == true`, `result.CallID` matches the input `call.ID`, and `result.Content` is non-empty.

- [x] **Add test `TestURLFetch_ParentContextWinsOverPerRequestTimeout`** — `internal/tool/url_fetch_test.go`: new test function `TestURLFetch_ParentContextWinsOverPerRequestTimeout`. Stand up an `httptest.NewServer` whose handler blocks for 2 seconds. Pass a parent context with a deadline shorter than the per-request timeout (e.g., 50ms). Assert: `result.IsError == true`. This confirms the parent context still wins when its deadline is shorter. (This overlaps with the existing `TestURLFetch_ContextCancellation` but explicitly documents the interaction between the two timeouts.)

- [x] **Add test `TestURLFetch_FastResponseUnaffectedByTimeout`** — `internal/tool/url_fetch_test.go`: new test function `TestURLFetch_FastResponseUnaffectedByTimeout`. Stand up an `httptest.NewServer` that responds immediately with `"fast response"`. Pass `context.Background()`. Assert: `result.IsError == false`, `result.Content == "fast response"`. Confirms the timeout does not interfere with normal fast responses.

### Phase 2: Implementation (Green)

- [x] **Define the timeout constant** — `internal/tool/url_fetch.go`: add an unexported package-level constant `urlFetchTimeout = 15 * time.Second` near the existing `maxReadBytes` constant. Import `"time"` if not already imported.

- [x] **Wrap the request context with `context.WithTimeout`** — `internal/tool/url_fetch.go`: in `urlFetchExecute()`, immediately after the scheme validation block (line ~93) and before `http.NewRequestWithContext`, create a derived context: `reqCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, urlFetchTimeout)` followed by `defer cancel()`. Pass `reqCtx` (not `ctx`) to `http.NewRequestWithContext`. This ensures the timeout governs DNS, TCP connect, TLS, request send, and header read. The `io.ReadAll` on `resp.Body` is also governed because the body reader inherits the request's context.

### Phase 3: Verify

- [x] **Run all existing tests** — `internal/tool/url_fetch_test.go`: execute `go test ./internal/tool/ -run TestURLFetch -v -count=1`. All 13 existing tests plus the 3 new tests must pass. Zero failures.

- [x] **Run vet** — execute `go vet ./internal/tool/`. Zero findings.

### Parallelism Notes

All tasks within this milestone are sequential (TDD order). However, this entire milestone (001) is independent of milestone 002 (HTML stripping) and can be developed concurrently on separate branches if desired.
