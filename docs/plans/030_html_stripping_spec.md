# Spec 030: Strip HTML from `text/html` Responses in `url_fetch` Tool

**Milestone:** 002 from `docs/plans/000_url_fetch_timeout_and_html_stripping_milestones.md`  
**Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Branch:** `issue-17-url-fetch-timeout-html-strip` (off `develop`)

---

## Section 1: Context & Constraints

### Codebase Structure

The `url_fetch` tool is self-contained within `internal/tool/`:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `internal/tool/url_fetch.go` (~133 lines) | Tool definition + execution logic (includes 15s per-request timeout from milestone 001) |
| `internal/tool/url_fetch_test.go` (~397 lines) | 19 existing test cases (13 original + 3 timeout tests + 3 from milestone 001) |
| `internal/tool/tool.go` | `ToolEntry` type, `ExecContext` struct, `toolVerboseLog` |

No other packages reference `url_fetch` internals. All changes are scoped to `internal/tool/`.

### Current Behavior

- `urlFetchExecute` reads the response body via `io.ReadAll(io.LimitReader(resp.Body, maxReadBytes+1))` where `maxReadBytes = 10000`.
- The raw body bytes are converted to a string and returned verbatim, regardless of `Content-Type`.
- For `text/html` responses, this means full HTML markup — `<script>`, `<style>`, navigation, ads, boilerplate — is sent to the LLM, wasting the 10,000 character budget on noise.
- Truncation (appending `"\n... [response truncated, exceeded 10000 characters]"`) is applied if the body exceeds `maxReadBytes`. This currently happens on the raw HTML, before any stripping.
- Non-2xx responses return `fmt.Sprintf("HTTP %d: %s", resp.StatusCode, bodyStr)` with `IsError: true`.

### Decisions Already Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Use `golang.org/x/net/html` for HTML stripping** | DOM-based parsing handles malformed HTML, nested scripts, and edge cases correctly. User explicitly chose this over regex. |
| **Strip `<script>` and `<style>` elements (including all children)** | These elements contain code/CSS that is noise for LLMs. Matches the TypeScript implementation. |
| **Preserve `<noscript>` content** | `<noscript>` often contains meaningful fallback text. Only `<script>` and `<style>` are stripped. |
| **Detect `text/html` via `mime.ParseMediaType` on the `Content-Type` header** | Correctly handles parameters like `charset=utf-8`, `boundary`, etc. More robust than `strings.HasPrefix`. |
| **Truncation applies after stripping** | Stripping reduces content size, so truncating after stripping maximizes useful content within the 10,000 character limit. |
| **HTML stripping applies to error responses (non-2xx)** | Error pages are often HTML. Stripping before returning the error body keeps error messages clean. The `"HTTP %d: "` prefix is preserved. |
| **Whitespace collapsing** | After extracting text nodes from the DOM, consecutive whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) MUST be collapsed to single spaces and the result trimmed. This prevents large runs of blank lines from wasting the character budget. |
| **`maxReadBytes` (10,000) unchanged** | The existing limit is sufficient for LLM consumption. |
| **`golang.org/x/net` is a new direct dependency** | It is NOT currently in `go.mod`. It must be added via `go get golang.org/x/net`. It is a Go official sub-repository, well-maintained, and widely used. |

### Approaches Ruled Out — Do Not Re-Evaluate

| Approach | Why Rejected |
|----------|-------------|
| **Regex-based HTML stripping** (`regexp` stdlib) | User explicitly chose DOM parsing. Regex is fragile with malformed HTML, can't properly handle nested `<script>` tags, and fails on edge cases like `<script>` inside attribute values. |
| **Using `x/net/html` `Tokenizer` (streaming)** | The full `html.Parse` tree approach is simpler to reason about for element skipping (script/style) and produces cleaner code. Performance is not a concern at 10KB max input. |

### Constraints

- **No new public API.** The HTML stripping function (`stripHTML` or similar) MUST be unexported. All changes are internal to the `tool` package.
- **All 19 existing tests must pass unchanged.** None of the existing tests serve `text/html` content (they all use plain text or no Content-Type), so they are unaffected by HTML stripping.
- **Red/green TDD required.** Write failing tests first, then implement.
- **One new dependency:** `golang.org/x/net`. No other new dependencies.

## Section 2: Requirements

### R1: Content-Type Detection

When `urlFetchExecute` receives an HTTP response, it MUST check the `Content-Type` response header to determine whether to strip HTML.

- The media type MUST be parsed using `mime.ParseMediaType` from the Go stdlib.
- If the media type is `text/html`, the response body MUST be processed through HTML stripping before being returned.
- If the media type is anything other than `text/html` (including `application/json`, `text/plain`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `text/xml`, or any other type), the response body MUST be returned verbatim (existing behavior, unchanged).
- If the `Content-Type` header is missing or cannot be parsed, the response body MUST be returned verbatim (existing behavior, unchanged). Do not guess or sniff content type.

### R2: HTML Stripping Behavior

When the response is `text/html`, the raw body string MUST be processed to extract meaningful text content:

- **Parse the HTML** into a DOM tree using `golang.org/x/net/html`.
- **Remove `<script>` elements** and all their children (text nodes, nested elements, everything). No content from inside `<script>` tags may appear in the output.
- **Remove `<style>` elements** and all their children. No content from inside `<style>` tags may appear in the output.
- **Preserve all other text nodes.** Text inside `<p>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, `<li>`, `<td>`, `<noscript>`, and all other non-script/non-style elements MUST be preserved.
- **Collapse whitespace.** After extracting text nodes, all runs of consecutive whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns) MUST be collapsed to a single space. The final result MUST be trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace.
- **Return the extracted text.** The stripped text replaces the raw HTML body in the result.

### R3: Ordering — Strip Before Truncate

The processing pipeline for `text/html` responses MUST be:

1. Read the raw body (up to `maxReadBytes + 1` bytes, existing behavior).
2. Convert to string (existing behavior).
3. **Strip HTML** (new step — only for `text/html`).
4. Apply truncation if the **stripped** text exceeds `maxReadBytes` (existing behavior, but now applied to stripped text instead of raw HTML).

This ordering ensures that stripping reduces the content size first, maximizing useful content within the 10,000 character budget.

### R4: Error Responses (Non-2xx)

HTML stripping MUST apply to non-2xx responses when the `Content-Type` is `text/html`.

- The existing error format `"HTTP %d: %s"` MUST be preserved. The `%s` placeholder receives the stripped text (instead of raw HTML).
- Example: A 404 page with HTML body becomes `"HTTP 404: Page not found"` (stripped text) instead of `"HTTP 404: <!DOCTYPE html><html>..."`.

### R5: Malformed HTML

The HTML stripping function MUST handle malformed HTML gracefully:

- If `html.Parse` returns an error, the raw body MUST be returned verbatim (no stripping). Do not return an error to the caller — treat parse failure as a fallback to existing behavior.
- If the HTML is valid but produces no text content after stripping (e.g., a page with only scripts and styles), the result MUST be an empty string.

### R6: No Change to Non-HTML Responses

Responses with `Content-Type` values other than `text/html` MUST behave identically to today. No observable difference in output, error handling, truncation, or verbose logging. This includes but is not limited to:

- `application/json`
- `text/plain`
- `text/xml` / `application/xml`
- `application/xhtml+xml`
- Missing `Content-Type` header
- Unparseable `Content-Type` header

### R7: No Change to Verbose Logging

The existing verbose logging behavior (URL sanitization, status code, truncation notice) MUST NOT change. The verbose log reports the URL and status code, not the body content, so HTML stripping does not affect it.

---

### Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8` | HTML stripping applies. `mime.ParseMediaType` extracts `text/html` correctly. |
| `Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1` | HTML stripping applies. Charset parameter is ignored for detection purposes. |
| `Content-Type: TEXT/HTML` | HTML stripping applies. Media type comparison MUST be case-insensitive (per RFC 2045). `mime.ParseMediaType` handles this. |
| `Content-Type: text/plain` | No stripping. Body returned verbatim. |
| `Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml` | No stripping. Body returned verbatim. Only `text/html` triggers stripping. |
| No `Content-Type` header | No stripping. Body returned verbatim. |
| `Content-Type` header present but unparseable | No stripping. Body returned verbatim. |
| HTML with only `<script>` and `<style>` | Stripping produces empty string. Empty string is returned. |
| HTML with nested `<script>` inside `<div>` | The `<script>` and its children are removed. Text in the `<div>` outside the `<script>` is preserved. |
| HTML with `<script>` containing `</script>` in a string literal | `html.Parse` handles this correctly per the HTML5 parsing spec. The parser knows where `<script>` ends. |
| HTML with `<style>` containing `</style>` in a comment | `html.Parse` handles this correctly. |
| Deeply nested HTML (100+ levels) | `html.Parse` handles this. No stack overflow at 10KB input. |
| HTML with HTML entities (`&amp;`, `&#x27;`, etc.) | `html.Parse` decodes entities in text nodes automatically. The extracted text contains decoded characters. |
| Empty HTML body (`""`) | `html.Parse` on empty string produces an empty document. Stripping produces empty string. |
| HTML body `"<html><body></body></html>"` | No text nodes. Stripping produces empty string. |
| Non-2xx with `Content-Type: text/html` | HTML stripping applies. Result is `"HTTP 404: [stripped text]"`. |
| Non-2xx with `Content-Type: application/json` | No stripping. Result is `"HTTP 500: {\"error\": \"...\"}` (existing behavior). |
| Response body exceeds `maxReadBytes` and is `text/html` | Raw body is read up to `maxReadBytes + 1` bytes (existing). Then stripped. Then truncation check on stripped text. If stripped text ≤ `maxReadBytes`, no truncation notice (stripping saved space). If stripped text > `maxReadBytes`, truncation notice appended. |
| `<noscript>` element | Content preserved. Only `<script>` and `<style>` are removed. |
| Text with excessive whitespace between elements | Collapsed to single spaces. `"  Hello   \n\n  World  "` becomes `"Hello World"`. |

### Parallelism Notes

The HTML stripping function (`stripHTML`) is a pure function with no dependencies on the HTTP request or response handling. Its tests can be written and verified independently of the integration into `urlFetchExecute`. This means:

- **The `stripHTML` unit tests** (testing the pure function in isolation with various HTML inputs) can be developed in parallel with...
- **The integration tests** (testing `urlFetchExecute` end-to-end with `httptest.NewServer` serving `text/html` content).

Both test groups must be written before implementation (red phase), but they test different things and can be authored concurrently.

The implementation itself is sequential: `stripHTML` must exist before `urlFetchExecute` can call it.
