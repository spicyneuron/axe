# Spec 029: Add 15-Second Per-Request HTTP Timeout to `url_fetch` Tool

**Milestone:** 001 from `docs/plans/000_url_fetch_timeout_and_html_stripping_milestones.md`  
**Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Branch:** `issue-17-url-fetch-timeout-html-strip` (off `develop`)

---

## Section 1: Context & Constraints

### Codebase Structure

The `url_fetch` tool is self-contained within `internal/tool/`:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `internal/tool/url_fetch.go` (127 lines) | Tool definition + execution logic |
| `internal/tool/url_fetch_test.go` (315 lines) | 13 existing test cases |
| `internal/tool/tool.go` | `ToolEntry` type, `ExecContext` struct, `toolVerboseLog` |

No other packages reference `url_fetch` internals. All changes are scoped to `internal/tool/`.

### Current Behavior

- `urlFetchExecute` creates an HTTP request via `http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, ...)` and executes it with `http.DefaultClient.Do(req)`.
- There is **no per-request timeout**. The only timeout protection is the parent `ctx` passed from the agent runner (default 120 seconds).
- A slow server that trickles data or delays the response will block the agent for up to 120 seconds before the parent context cancels.

### Decisions Already Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **15-second hardcoded timeout** | Matches the TypeScript implementation's `AbortSignal.timeout(15000)`. Long enough for slow servers, short enough to not block an agent run. |
| **Use `context.WithTimeout` on the request context** | Idiomatic Go. Wraps the incoming `ctx` with a 15-second deadline. The shorter of the two deadlines (parent vs. per-request) wins automatically. |
| **Timeout is NOT configurable via TOML** | Out of scope for this issue. Can be revisited in a future issue. |

### Approaches Ruled Out — Do Not Re-Evaluate

| Approach | Why Rejected |
|----------|-------------|
| Custom HTTP client with transport-level timeout | Overly complex. `context.WithTimeout` achieves the same result with less code. |
| Configurable timeout per agent | Out of scope. |

### Constraints

- **No new public API.** All changes are internal to the `tool` package.
- **All 13 existing tests must pass unchanged.** None of them are affected by a 15-second timeout because:
  - Most tests use `httptest.NewServer` which responds instantly.
  - `TestURLFetch_ContextCancellation` uses a 50ms parent timeout. Since `min(50ms, 15s) = 50ms`, the parent timeout still wins.
  - `TestURLFetch_ConnectionRefused` fails at TCP connect, before any timeout applies.
- **Red/green TDD required.** Write failing tests first, then implement.
- **No new dependencies.** `context.WithTimeout` is stdlib.

## Section 2: Requirements

### R1: Per-Request Timeout

When `urlFetchExecute` makes an HTTP request, the request MUST be governed by a 15-second timeout **in addition to** the parent context's deadline.

- The timeout starts when the HTTP request begins (before TCP connect).
- The timeout covers the entire request lifecycle: DNS resolution, TCP connect, TLS handshake, sending the request, and reading the response headers.
- If the 15-second timeout fires before the parent context's deadline, the request MUST be cancelled and an error returned.
- If the parent context's deadline fires before the 15-second timeout, the request MUST be cancelled and an error returned (existing behavior, unchanged).
- The shorter deadline always wins. This is the natural behavior of nested Go contexts.

### R2: Timeout Constant

The 15-second timeout value MUST be defined as a package-level constant (unexported) for clarity and testability. It MUST NOT be a magic number inline.

### R3: Error Behavior on Timeout

When the per-request timeout fires:

- The result MUST have `IsError: true`.
- The result MUST contain the error message from the context cancellation (Go's `context.DeadlineExceeded` surfaces through `http.Client.Do`).
- The `CallID` MUST be set to the incoming `call.ID` (existing behavior, unchanged).
- The verbose log MUST still fire via the existing `defer` block (existing behavior, unchanged).

### R4: No Change to Existing Behavior for Fast Responses

Responses that complete within 15 seconds MUST behave identically to today. No observable difference in output, error handling, truncation, or verbose logging.

### R5: No Change to `maxReadBytes` or Truncation Logic

The timeout governs the HTTP request lifecycle only. The existing `maxReadBytes` (10,000) limit and truncation logic are unrelated and MUST NOT change.

---

### Edge Cases

| Case | Expected Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| Server responds in 14.9 seconds | Success. Response returned normally. |
| Server responds in 15.1 seconds | Error. Per-request timeout fires. `IsError: true`. |
| Parent context has 5-second deadline, server responds in 6 seconds | Error. Parent context fires first (existing behavior). |
| Parent context has 5-second deadline, server responds in 4 seconds | Success. Both deadlines are satisfied. |
| Parent context has no deadline, server never responds | Error. Per-request 15-second timeout fires. |
| Server sends headers quickly but trickles body over 20 seconds | The timeout covers the full request. If `http.Client.Do` returns before the timeout (it returns after headers), the body read via `io.ReadAll` is governed by the same context. The request is cancelled at 15 seconds. |
| Connection refused (TCP RST) | Error returned immediately, before any timeout. Unchanged behavior. |
| DNS resolution fails | Error returned immediately or quickly, before the 15-second timeout. Unchanged behavior. |

### Parallelism Notes

This milestone is a single, focused change. There are no independent sub-tasks that benefit from parallel execution. The test(s) and implementation are sequential (red/green TDD).

However, this milestone (001) is **independent of milestone 002** (HTML stripping). They can be developed on the same branch sequentially but do not depend on each other.
